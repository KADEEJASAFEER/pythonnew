A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects
Tuples are sequences, just like lists
he main difference between the tuples
the lists is that the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists
Tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square bracket

Creating a tuple is as simple as putting different comma-separated value
Optionally, you can put these comma-separated values between parentheses also
