#PYTHON COLLECTIONS
#what is collection and when to use collections

#when we use array we can store only single type of data
#eg: if we declare array as integer we can store only integers we can't use strinf values
# size of array is fixed or static
#to overcome array we use collections
#array can store only homogeneous data
#size is fixed in array

#num=[10,20,30,"hello","hai",True]
#print(num)

#what is collection
# if we want to store same and different type of data and than can refer by using single name and also collection
# treats different independent object as single entity
#using collection we can store homogeneous data as well as hetrogeneous data
#size is not fixed, it can be extended dynamically
#collection treats each object as single independent entity

#DIFFERENT TYPES OF COLLECTIONS:
#1) LIST
#2) TUPLE
#3) SET
#4) DICTIONARY

#  we will check some common features
# define
# is it possible to store different types of data
# is it possible to store duplicate data
#insertion order is prserved or not
#mutable or immutable(is it possible to update or not)
